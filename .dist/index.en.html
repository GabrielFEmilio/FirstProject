    <h1>Personal Presentation</h1>
    <p>Hello, <span class="Name"></span>. My name is Gabriel Emilio and I will become a Software Engineering student starting in 2026.</p>
    <p>I am excited to share a little about my journey with you.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a technology enthusiast and have a passion for learning new programming languages and development tools.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am preparing to enter the Software Engineering course, where I hope to deepen my knowledge and skills, which today are quite basic and limited.</p>
